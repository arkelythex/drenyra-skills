# Drenyra Skills — Brand & Banner

> **Normative source:** the Drenyra ecosystem brand contract —
> [`drenyra-ai/contracts/brand-system.md`](https://github.com/arkelythex/drenyra-ai/blob/main/contracts/brand-system.md)
> (v0.3 DRAFT) and canonical tokens at `contracts/brand-system/tokens.json`.
>
> The ecosystem design system is **the Dreamcoder Workbench canonical tokens**:
> Cocoa/Lúcuma Light (warm ivory `#F3EADC`, dark ink `#17120D`) editorial
> surface and Anthracite Steel dark, with cocoa `#824F16` / terracotta
> `#A7471C` accents — readability before decoration. No product invents its
> own palette.

The canonical set lives in
[`drenyra-ai/docs/assets/brand/gpt-image-prompts.md`](https://github.com/arkelythex/drenyra-ai/blob/main/docs/assets/brand/gpt-image-prompts.md).
The Drenyra Skills prompt is the **normative skill catalog** motif:

```text
Subject: versioned accounting and tax knowledge as a normative skill catalog. The hero on the right third is a single versioned skill ficha — a warm ivory document card (surface #FFF7EA on #F3EADC paper) with an editorial identity header: id, version, jurisdiction, maxAutonomy, and normative basis in dark ink #17120D, with the normative citations in cocoa #824F16. A sage #315B31 Pinned Definition seal stamps the corner.

Behind the card, a thin printed supply chain resolves like a timeline: source → author → review → version → conformance → pin → consume, in warm tan #DECBB1 with small node marks. Editorial, calm, audit-grade — a normative catalog entry, not a toolbox, not a marketplace card, not a dashboard tile.

Signature detail: the Pinned Definition seal engraving and the printed conformance timeline resolving under the ficha.
```

## Validate

```bash
node ../drenyra-ai/scripts/brand-conformance.mjs \
  assets/branding/drenyra-skills-banner.png
# expect: ✓ <file> (coverage >= 0.92) ... PASS
```

The checker is referenced from the sibling-checkout layout: clone `drenyra-ai`
next to this repository so `../drenyra-ai/scripts/brand-conformance.mjs`
resolves (the same `../<repo>` layout `drenyra-ai/scripts/brand-ecosystem-status.mjs`
assumes) — no host-specific absolute path.

Iterate with the checker's off-palette feedback until coverage ≥ 0.92. Then
`bun run brand:ecosystem` in drenyra-ai must report this repo `PASS` before
brand-system can freeze to v0.3.

## Freeze gate

`brand-system` freezes to v0.3 only when every consuming repo (App Web, Pi,
Engram, Skills, Guardian Angel) passes the same checker on its brand assets in
both themes.
