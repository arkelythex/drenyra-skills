# Drenyra Skills — Brand & Banner

> **Normative source:** the Drenyra ecosystem brand contract —
> [`drenyra-ai/contracts/brand-system.md`](https://github.com/arkelythex/drenyra-ai/blob/main/contracts/brand-system.md)
> (v0.2 DRAFT) and canonical tokens at `contracts/brand-system/tokens.json`.
>
> The ecosystem design system is **the same system as Drenyra apps/web**: dark
> + light themes and the cyan/violet accent system (DTCG token pipeline), with
> the Dreamcoder-inspired compositional language. Drenyra Skills must **not**
> invent its own palette — in either theme.

## Regeneration prompt (ChatGPT Images 2.0)
> **Art direction (2026-08-11):** the Shared DNA block was upgraded to the premium minimal-maximal direction — see [creative-brief.md](https://github.com/arkelythex/drenyra-ai/blob/main/docs/assets/brand/creative-brief.md). Combine the product section below with the **current** Shared DNA from [gpt-image-prompts.md](https://github.com/arkelythex/drenyra-ai/blob/main/docs/assets/brand/gpt-image-prompts.md); the embedded prompt is the product section only and may trail the canonical file.

The canonical set lives in
[`drenyra-ai/docs/assets/brand/gpt-image-prompts.md`](https://github.com/arkelythex/drenyra-ai/blob/main/docs/assets/brand/gpt-image-prompts.md).
The Drenyra Skills prompt is the **layered knowledge folios** motif:

```text
Drenyra ecosystem brand banner in the Dreamcoder-inspired visual language:
calm, premium, architectural. Background: deep anthracite-navy canvas #0B0E11
with a faint blueprint grid at ~3% white opacity and a subtle 1% film grain to
smooth gradients. Two aurora glows at low intensity (5-8% opacity): cyan
#3CE6D8 on the upper right, violet #9B7FE8 on the lower left, both diffused
into the canvas with no hard edges. Accent colors allowed ONLY: cyan #3CE6D8
(lighter #6AEFE4, dimmer #1F8A80), violet #9B7FE8 (lighter #B8A2F0, dimmer
#7B66C0), success green #4ADE94, muted blue-gray #A8B0BC, plus the surface
ladder #12161B, #1A1F26, #20262E for layered panels and elevation shadows.
All gradients blend exclusively between these colors. Composition language:
layered elevation with soft inner shadows, curved geometry (orbital arcs,
concentric rings, sweeping Bézier curves), and tiny luminous spark accents at
arc intersections. Subject: layered knowledge folios with a curved spine.
Focal point on the right third: three overlapping folio sheets (surfaces
#12161B, #1A1F26, #20262E) whose spines curve outward like an open book, edges
in cyan #3CE6D8 and violet #9B7FE8. Each sheet carries a small abstract
rule-glyph (a §-mark formed by a simple curve in muted blue-gray #A8B0BC) and
a tiny spark sits at each glyph's curve tip. A version tag in success green
#4ADE94 floats on the top folio with a soft halo. Composition: the folio stack
as a calm hero, a single sweeping arc crossing behind it. NO cartoon, NO
mascot, NO photorealism, NO organic texture. NO TEXT of any kind — no letters,
words, numbers, or logos; the product name lives in the README, never in the
raster. Aspect ratio exactly 1400:460 (banner). Keep C2PA provenance metadata
and the imperceptible watermark enabled.
```

Light variant (optional): swap sheets to `#FAFAF9` / `#FFFFFF` / `#F2F2F0`,
spines to `#2ECFC2` and `#6B54A8`, tag to `#1A8F52`.

## Validate

```bash
node ../drenyra-ai/scripts/brand-conformance.mjs \
  assets/branding/drenyra-skills-banner.png
# expect: ✓ <file> (coverage >= 0.92) ... PASS
```
    
The checker is referenced from the sibling-checkout layout: clone `drenyra-ai`
next to this repository so `../drenyra-ai/scripts/brand-conformance.mjs`
resolves (the same `../<repo>` layout `drenyra-ai/scripts/brand-ecosystem-status.mjs`
assumes) — no host-specific absolute path.
    
Iterate with the checker's off-palette feedback until coverage ≥ 0.92. Then
`bun run brand:ecosystem` in drenyra-ai must report this repo `PASS` before
brand-system can freeze to v0.3.
